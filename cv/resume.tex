%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

	GNeRF: GAN-Based Neural Radiance Field without Posed Camera \\
	\textit{Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021} \\
	{\bf Oral Presentation: 3.4\%} \\
	We introduce GNeRF, a method that can estimate neural radiance fields and camera poses jointly when the cameras are initialized at random poses in complex scenarios (outside-in scenes, even with less texture or intense noise). We achieve this by marrying Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with Neural Radiance Field.

	LGNN: A Context-Aware Line Segment Detector \\
	\textit{Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM MM), 2020} \\
	{\bf Poster: 27.9\%} \\
	Existing approaches require a computationally expensive verification or postprocessing step. Our LGNN employs a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for proposing line segments directly, with a graph neural network (GNN) module for reasoning their connectivities. LGNN achieves comparable performance and enables time-sensitive 3D applications.
